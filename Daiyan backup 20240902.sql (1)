Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available. By pre-ordering the “TULISAN” book, you ensure that you’re amongst the first customer to receive this much-anticipated book in the first print that includes exclusive packages released in very limited quantity so you absolutely must get your hands on it before it sold out!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How long is the pre-order period of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe “TULISAN” book will open for pre-order on 26 August 2023 and ongoing while stock lasts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Who is the publisher of “TULISAN”? Can you tell me more about important highlights of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\n“TULISAN” by Daiyan Trisha is proudly published by Nukilan Biruni Publication and written by the celebrated Malaysian celebrity and artist, Daiyan Trisha. “TULISAN” is a collection of poetry about love and life experienced through Daiyan herself. “TULISAN” contains 222 pages of poem entries that explores the theme of heartbreak, loss, love, self-worth and spiritual.

This authentic selection of poems written in Daiyan’s voice will surely move your heart.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How many packages are available and what will be included in each package?</strong>\r\n\r\nThere will be 3 packages released altogether which is Package A, Package B and Package C. Package A will include the hardcover with Daiyan’s autograph. Package B will include the autographed book and Daiyan’s special written letter. Package C will include the autographed book packaged in an exclusive gift box that contains Daiyan’s special letter and 8 photo cards. ALL these packages are a limited-edition and will not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order? What are the platforms available to place the order?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll customers residing in Malaysia may purchase the book via our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a> or through our Shopee store ‘nukilanbirunitrading’.\r\n\r\nCustomers residing overseas may place an order only through our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you face any technical difficulties while placing the order, please do not hesitate to contact our admin at <a href=\"mailto:sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com\">sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com</a> or +60177860821.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Will this book be available to purchase in any of the major bookstore?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe hardcover edition of Tulisan is only available for this first batch of pre-order and made exclusive online only and not available at any bookstore. The subsequent print of this book will be in a softcover edition which will then be distributed to the major physical bookstores (date available for this will be announced soon).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Will there be a second batch of “TULISAN”?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, we will re-print the book and release in ready stock after the pre-order batch has sold out. However, the subsequent batch will only be available in a softcover version and will not include any of the exclusive packages as the pre-order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine my pre-order with other books from Nukilan Biruni?</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, but if you combine the “TULISAN” pre-order with any other ready stock products from our product listing, you will have to wait for the “TULISAN” fulfilment period for it to be shipped in the same delivery. The items will not be shipped separately.

Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available.

Can you tell me more about the important highlights of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\n“TULISAN” by Daiyan Trisha is proudly published by Nukilan Biruni Publication and written by the distinguished Malaysian celebrity, artist and debut author, Daiyan Trisha. “TULISAN” is a mixture of Malay and English poetry collection about love and life which paints a vivid canvas of Daiyan’s inner world. “TULISAN” contains 222 poem entries that explore the theme of heartbreak, loss, love, self-worth and spiritual connection through her personal odyssey.

Full Moon Package, which is the greatest package of all, will include the autographed hardcover packaged in an exclusive gift box that contains Daiyan’s special letter and 8 photo cards. ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order?

The subsequent print of this book will be in a softcover edition which will then be distributed to the major physical bookstores (date available for this will be announced soon).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Will there be a second batch of “TULISAN”?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, we will re-print the book and release in ready stock after the pre-order batch has sold out. However, the subsequent batch may only be available in a softcover version and may not include any of the exclusive packages as the pre-order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine my pre-order with other books from Nukilan Biruni?</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, but if you combine the “TULISAN” pre-order with any other ready stock products from our product listing, you will have to wait for the “TULISAN” fulfilment period for it to be shipped in the same delivery. The items will not be shipped separately. All the products in your order will be shipped out together once all items are ready to be delivered according to the pre-order estimated delivery period.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I amend or modify my pre-order?</strong>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you cannot amend or modify your order once you have checked out and payment has been made.

Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available.

Can you tell me more about the important highlights of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\n“TULISAN” by Daiyan Trisha is proudly published by Nukilan Biruni Publication and written by the distinguished Malaysian celebrity, artist and debut author, Daiyan Trisha. “TULISAN” is a mixture of Malay and English poetry collection about love and life which paints a vivid canvas of Daiyan’s inner world. “TULISAN” contains 222 poem entries that explore the theme of heartbreak, loss, love, self-worth and spiritual connection through her personal odyssey.

Full Moon Package, which is the greatest package of all, will include the autographed hardcover packaged in an exclusive gift box that contains Daiyan’s special letter and 8 photo cards. ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order? What are the platforms available to place the order?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll customers residing in Malaysia may purchase the book via our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a> or through our Shopee store ‘nukilanbirunitrading’.\r\n\r\nCustomers residing overseas may place an order only through our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you face any technical difficulties while placing the order via our website, please do not hesitate to contact our admin at <a href=\"mailto:sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com\">sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com</a> or +60177860821.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Will this book be available to purchase in any of the major bookstore?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe hardcover edition of Tulisan is only available for this first batch of pre-order and made exclusive online only and not available at any bookstore. The subsequent print of this book will be in a softcover edition which will then be distributed to the major physical bookstores (date available for this will be announced soon).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Will there be a second batch of “TULISAN”?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, we will re-print the book and release in ready stock after the pre-order batch has sold out. However, the subsequent batch may only be available in a softcover version and may not include any of the exclusive packages as the pre-order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine my pre-order with other books from Nukilan Biruni?</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, but if you combine the “TULISAN” pre-order with any other ready stock products from our product listing, you will have to wait for the “TULISAN” fulfilment period for it to be shipped in the same delivery. The items will not be shipped separately. All the products in your order will be shipped out together once all items are ready to be delivered according to the pre-order estimated delivery period.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I amend or modify my pre-order?</strong>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you cannot amend or modify your order once you have checked out and payment has been made.

Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available.

Can you tell me more about the important highlights of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\n“TULISAN” by Daiyan Trisha is proudly published by Nukilan Biruni Publication and written by the distinguished Malaysian celebrity, artist and debut author, Daiyan Trisha. “TULISAN” is a mixture of Malay and English poetry collection about love and life which paints a vivid canvas of Daiyan’s inner world. “TULISAN” contains 222 poem entries that explore the theme of heartbreak, loss, love, self-worth and spiritual connection through her personal odyssey.

Full Moon Package, which is the greatest package of all, will include the autographed hardcover packaged in an exclusive gift box that contains Daiyan’s special letter and 8 photo cards. ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order? What are the platforms available to place the order?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll customers residing in Malaysia may purchase the book via our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a> or through our Shopee store ‘nukilanbirunitrading’.\r\n\r\nCustomers residing overseas may place an order only through our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you face any technical difficulties while placing the order via our website, please do not hesitate to contact our admin at <a href=\"mailto:sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com\">sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com</a> or +60177860821.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Will this book be available to purchase in any of the major bookstore?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe hardcover edition of Tulisan is only available for this first batch of pre-order and made exclusive online only and not available at any bookstore. The subsequent print of this book will be in a softcover edition which will then be distributed to the major physical bookstores (date available for this will be announced soon).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Will there be a second batch of “TULISAN”?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, we will re-print the book and release in ready stock after the pre-order batch has sold out. However, the subsequent batch may only be available in a softcover version and may not include any of the exclusive packages as the pre-order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine my pre-order with other books from Nukilan Biruni?</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, but if you combine the “TULISAN” pre-order with any other ready stock products from our product listing, you will have to wait for the “TULISAN” fulfilment period for it to be shipped in the same delivery. The items will not be shipped separately. All the products in your order will be shipped out together once all items are ready to be delivered according to the pre-order estimated delivery period.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I amend or modify my pre-order?</strong>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you cannot amend or modify your order once you have checked out and payment has been made.

Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available.

ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order?

Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available.

Can you tell me more about the important highlights of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\n“TULISAN” by Daiyan Trisha is proudly published by Nukilan Biruni Publication and written by the distinguished Malaysian celebrity, artist and debut author, Daiyan Trisha. “TULISAN” is a mixture of Malay and English poetry collection about love and life which paints a vivid canvas of Daiyan’s inner world. “TULISAN” contains 222 poem entries that explore the theme of heartbreak, loss, love, self-worth and spiritual connection through her personal odyssey.

Full Moon Package, which is the greatest package of all, will include the autographed hardcover packaged in an exclusive gift box that contains Daiyan’s special letter and 8 photo cards. ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order? What are the platforms available to place the order?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll customers residing in Malaysia may purchase the book via our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a> or through our Shopee store ‘nukilanbirunitrading’.\r\n\r\nCustomers residing overseas may place an order only through our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you face any technical difficulties while placing the order via our website, please do not hesitate to contact our admin at <a href=\"mailto:sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com\">sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com</a> or +60177860821.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Will this book be available to purchase in any of the major bookstore?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe hardcover edition of Tulisan is only available for this first batch of pre-order and made exclusive online only and not available at any bookstore.

However, the subsequent batch may only be available in a softcover version and may not include any of the exclusive packages as the pre-order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine my pre-order with other books from Nukilan Biruni?</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, but if you combine the “TULISAN” pre-order with any other ready stock products from our product listing, you will have to wait for the “TULISAN” fulfilment period for it to be shipped in the same delivery. The items will not be shipped separately.

Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available.

Can you tell me more about the important highlights of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\n“TULISAN” by Daiyan Trisha is proudly published by Nukilan Biruni Publication and written by the distinguished Malaysian celebrity, artist and debut author, Daiyan Trisha. “TULISAN” is a mixture of Malay and English poetry collection about love and life which paints a vivid canvas of Daiyan’s inner world. “TULISAN” contains 222 poem entries that explore the theme of heartbreak, loss, love, self-worth and spiritual connection through her personal odyssey. It is aesthetically packaged in a limited-edition autographed hardcover and exquisite gold stamping. Experience first-hand the vulnerabilities, heartbreaks and the triumphs of a beautiful artist in this most-anticipated book of the year!\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How many packages are available and what will be included in each package?</strong>\r\n\r\nThere will be 3 packages released altogether which is the <strong>Eclipse Package</strong>, <strong>Crescent Package</strong> and <strong>Full Moon Package</strong>.

Full Moon Package, which is the greatest package of all, will include the autographed hardcover packaged in an exclusive gift box that contains Daiyan’s special letter and 8 photo cards. ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order? What are the platforms available to place the order?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll customers residing in Malaysia may purchase the book via our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a> or through our Shopee store ‘nukilanbirunitrading’.\r\n\r\nCustomers residing overseas may place an order only through our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you face any technical difficulties while placing the order via our website, please do not hesitate to contact our admin at <a href=\"mailto:sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com\">sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com</a> or +60177860821.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Will this book be available to purchase in any of the major bookstore?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe hardcover edition of Tulisan is only available for this first batch of pre-order and made exclusive online only and not available at any bookstore. The subsequent print of this book will be in a softcover edition which will then be distributed to the major physical bookstores (date available for this will be announced soon).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Will there be a second batch of “TULISAN”?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, we will re-print the book and release in ready stock after the pre-order batch has sold out. However, the subsequent batch may only be available in a softcover version and may not include any of the exclusive packages as the pre-order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine my pre-order with other books from Nukilan Biruni?</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, but if you combine the “TULISAN” pre-order with any other ready stock products from our product listing, you will have to wait for the “TULISAN” fulfilment period for it to be shipped in the same delivery. The items will not be shipped separately. All the products in your order will be shipped out together once all items are ready to be delivered according to the pre-order estimated delivery period.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I amend or modify my pre-order?</strong>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you cannot amend or modify your order once you have checked out and payment has been made.

Why should I pre-order the “TULISAN” book?</strong>\r\nPre-order allows you to purchase a product before the ready stock of the product is available. By pre-ordering the “TULISAN” book, you ensure that you’re amongst the first customer to receive this much-anticipated book in the first print that includes exclusive packages released in very limited quantity so you absolutely must get your hands on it before it sold out!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How long is the pre-order period of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe “TULISAN” book will open for pre-order on 26 August 2023 and ongoing while stock lasts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Who is the publisher of “TULISAN”? Can you tell me more about the important highlights of this book?</strong>\r\n\r\n“TULISAN” by Daiyan Trisha is proudly published by Nukilan Biruni Publication and written by the distinguished Malaysian celebrity, artist and debut author, Daiyan Trisha. “TULISAN” is a mixture of Malay and English poetry collection about love and life which paints a vivid canvas of Daiyan’s inner world. “TULISAN” contains 222 poem entries that explore the theme of heartbreak, loss, love, self-worth and spiritual connection through her personal odyssey. It is aesthetically packaged in a limited-edition autographed hardcover and exquisite gold stamping. Experience first-hand the vulnerabilities, heartbreaks and the triumphs of a beautiful artist in this most-anticipated book of the year!\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How many packages are available and what will be included in each package?</strong>\r\n\r\nThere will be 3 packages released altogether which is the <strong>Eclipse Package</strong>, <strong>Crescent Package</strong> and <strong>Full Moon Package</strong>. Eclipse Package will include the hardcover with Daiyan’s autograph. Crescent Package will include the autographed hardcover and Daiyan’s specially written and wax sealed letter. Full Moon Package, which is the greatest package of all, will include the autographed hardcover packaged in an exclusive gift box that contains Daiyan’s special letter and 8 photo cards. ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! All packages will be autographed by Daiyan Trisha. However, customers are not able to request any personalized name or notes for the order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I place an order? What are the platforms available to place the order?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll customers residing in Malaysia may purchase the book via our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a> or through our Shopee store ‘nukilanbirunitrading’.\r\n\r\nCustomers residing overseas may place an order only through our official website <a href=\"http://www.nukilanbiruni.com\">www.nukilanbiruni.com</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you face any technical difficulties while placing the order via our website, please do not hesitate to contact our admin at <a href=\"mailto:sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com\">sales.nukilanbiruni@gmail.com</a> or +60177860821.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Will this book be available to purchase in any of the major bookstore?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe hardcover edition of Tulisan is only available for this first batch of pre-order and made exclusive online only and not available at any bookstore. The subsequent print of this book will be in a softcover edition which will then be distributed to the major physical bookstores (date available for this will be announced soon).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Will there be a second batch of “TULISAN”?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, we will re-print the book and release in ready stock after the pre-order batch has sold out. However, the subsequent batch may only be available in a softcover version and may not include any of the exclusive packages as the pre-order.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine my pre-order with other books from Nukilan Biruni?</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, but if you combine the “TULISAN” pre-order with any other ready stock products from our product listing, you will have to wait for the “TULISAN” fulfilment period for it to be shipped in the same delivery. The items will not be shipped separately. All the products in your order will be shipped out together once all items are ready to be delivered according to the pre-order estimated delivery period.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I amend or modify my pre-order?</strong>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you cannot amend or modify your order once you have checked out and payment has been made.

ALL these packages are a limited-edition and might not be reproduced for the subsequent print.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Daiyan’s special letter personalized? </strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Daiyan’s special letter is not personalized. However, the letter is written from the heart by Daiyan herself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Are all the pre-order “TULISAN” books include an autograph by the author?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes!
